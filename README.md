Reference repository for future arch installations. This repo is public but in rough rough shape. This README will change once I have the shell scripts up and running.

Based off the following references:
- [Grant Mcdermott's arch tips repo](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/arch-tips)
- [Patrick Schratz Arch Linux setup guide for data science](https://pat-s.me/post/arch-install-guide-for-r/)
- [Anton Beloglazov's old arch cofig repo](https://github.com/beloglazov/arch-config)
